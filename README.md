# EDA-using-Sugar-Cane-production
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Sugarcane Production data to uncover trends, patterns, and insights across different continents and their countries


## Objectives
- Compare sugarcane production across continents  
- Identify top sugarcane-producing countries  
- Examine the relationship between acreage, production, and yield  
- Visualize global production efficiency  

---

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## Sample Visualizations
- Bar chart of top sugarcane-producing countries  
- Boxplot of yield across continents  
- Scatterplot of acreage vs production  
- Heatmap showing correlations between numeric features

## Key Insights
-Brazil is the top producer, followed by India and China.
-Production increases with acreage.
-South America has high yields per hectare.
-Africa has lower yields despite large acreage, showing efficiency gaps.
-Countries with smaller populations, like Australia, have higher production per person.
-Asia dominates total production due to India and China.
